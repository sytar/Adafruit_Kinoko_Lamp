# Adafruit_Kinoko_Lamp
Code for a Adafruit version of the Kinoko Lamp on Thingiverse

The code for this project was done with the assistance of the admins at the Adafruit Forums.  They were a huge help in learning
as well as troubleshooting my project.

Items used:
1) Adafruit Trinket - https://www.adafruit.com/products/1501
2) Adafruit NeoPixels - https://www.adafruit.com/products/1938
3) 1 Photocell  
4) 1 1K Resistor

This was my first attempt at working with an Arduino based project, and found that it was really not that hard. 
I have a basic background in programming with C++ and VB, but have not used it in many years.  

The Admins at the AdaFruit were a huge help.  Here are some of the Forum posts that I worked with them to help streamline 
my code, troubleshoot issues, and overall provide some great support!
